# Pinned DVC Get Started

This is a version of [iterative/example-get-started][get-started] used
to test DVC Studio internally. We pin it on a specific commit so our
tests don't break when the real repo is changed.

Check out the [real example-get-started repo][get-started] for a tutorial
on how to get started with DVC.
